### Goal

This is smart notes application. I coded this project to practice on my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS,
Context API and Material-UI in a real project.

### Benefits

Here are some ideas to benefit from this project:

- Take this project as a task and try to make it, and if you could not do a specific section, see how I make it in the
  source code (use comments to reach this section).
- Extract a code of a specific section and use it in your project.
- Review source code to see how other people code their projects.
- Edit on this project after studying its code well, to know how to work in pair-programming with other people
- Upgrade this project, and add your own sections or pages

### Demo

Here is the demo of this [application](https://notes.portfolio.salahineo.com/)

### Installation

Here are the guidelines to run this project on your localhost (you should install node.js on your machine at first):

1. Clone (Download) this repo on your machine
2. Open terminal in repo directory
3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to start this project on localhost

> You maybe asked to run this app in another port instead of port 3000, because there is already a process running on this port. Confirm this by hitting `y` key from keyboard.

### Technologies
